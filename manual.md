# Install these manually

## Dash docsets
Python3, Bash, Man pages, Docker, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Terraform, SVG

## Chrome extensions

* UBlock Origin: does a better job at blocking paywalls than Adblock Plus
* LastPass: obviously
* Stylus: custom themes for webpages. Install all the ones in the "stylish" dir.
* Event Merge for Google Calendar: visually merges identical events on multiple calendars

# Tools I have known and loved (but no longer use)
## Mac Apps

* coconutBattery: replaces the menu bar battery display and adds remaining time prediction (removed in Sierra)
  * After downloading and starting, click menu bar icon and open "Preferences"
  * Select "Launch at Startup" and "Show Icons"
  * Change format to `%r`
* MagicPrefs: fully customize magic mouse/touchpad gestures (just using for magic mouse ATM)
  * map one finger middle click to middle click (required futzing with the area)
  * map three finger touch to "Application Windows"
* Hammerspoon: advanced OSX automation in Lua. Eventually, I'll finish the window manager with this.
* Sublime Text 3
* Stay: save window positions when changing monitor configs
* Karabiner: remap any key. No really, any key. Last used to make media buttons on a custom keyboard act correctly.

## Chrome plugins

* MoveTab: a tool I wrote for moving tabs from one window to another with a keyboard shortcut. https://github.com/maxrothman/movetab
* The Great Suspender: suspends inactive tabs. Frees up toooons of memory
* Hacker Vision: I have a key for the pro version (it's free for a year). Flips colors on webpages for which there aren't Stylish themes
