#Alfred
Backup of all Alfred-related configs.

##Setup
* In Alfred's preferances, got to "Advanced"
* Under "syncing", set the sync folder to this directory's parent

##Additional Notes
Some Alfred workflows are not tracked in this repo. They fall into 2 categories:

* Developed by me, and thus in another repo
  * AWS: https://github.com/maxrothman/aws-alfred-workflow
  * Ubuntu AMI Finder: https://github.com/maxrothman/ubuntu-ec2-ami-finder-alfred-workflow
* Dash, which modifies its own executable
  * https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-Alfred-Workflow

These workflows are in this directory's `.gitignore`. If you install them manually, make sure their directories are still ignored.
