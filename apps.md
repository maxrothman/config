#Apps

Install all of these:

* Alfred: like Sublime's panels, but for the whole computer
* Sublime Text 3: my editor of choice
* Dash: offline documentation browser (integrates with Alfred)
  * Docsets: Man Pages, Python2, Python3, Mjolnir, Lua 5.2, Lua 5.3, Ansible, Nginx
* GitKraken? Eh, it's ok. Better than gitgui or gitk I guess.
* HammerSpoon: advanced OSX automation in Lua. Eventually, I'll finish the window manager with this.
* Stay: save window positions when changing monitor configs
* BetterSnapTool: tiling (at least until I finish my window manager)
* HyperSwitch: window-based switcher. I may replace this with HammerSpoon eventually.
* Day-O: adds a calendar panel to the OSX datetime display
* AppCleaner: fully uninstall apps
* Flux: so my eyes don't die
* VLC: duh.
* Karabiner: remap any key. No really, any key. Last used to make media buttons on a custom keyboard act correctly.
* MagicPrefs: fully customize magic mouse/touchpad gestures
