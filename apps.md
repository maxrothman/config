#Apps

Install all of these:

* Alfred: like Sublime's panels, but for the whole computer
* Sublime Text 3: my editor of choice
* Dash: offline documentation browser (integrates with Alfred)
  * Docsets: Man Pages, Bash, Python2, Python3, Hammerspoon, Lua 5.2, Lua 5.3, Ansible, Nginx, Terraform
* Hammerspoon: advanced OSX automation in Lua. Eventually, I'll finish the window manager with this.
* Stay: save window positions when changing monitor configs
* BetterSnapTool: tiling (at least until I finish my window manager)
* HyperSwitch: window-based switcher. I may replace this with Hammerspoon eventually.
* Day-O: adds a calendar panel to the OSX datetime display
* AppCleaner: fully uninstall apps
* Flux: so my eyes don't die (though this might be unnecessary on the newest MacOS)
* VLC: duh.
* Karabiner: remap any key. No really, any key. Last used to make media buttons on a custom keyboard act correctly.
* MagicPrefs: fully customize magic mouse/touchpad gestures (just using for magic mouse ATM)
  * map one finger middle click to middle click (required futzing with the area)
  * map three finger touch to "Application Windows"

Install these chrome plugins:

* AdBlock Plus: duh
* MoveTab: a tool I wrote for moving tabs from one window to another with a keyboard shortcut. https://github.com/maxrothman/movetab
* DevTools theme Zero Dark Matrix: dark theme for DevTools
* Hacker Vision: I have a key for the pro version (it's free for a year). Flips colors on webpages for which there aren't Stylish themes
* LastPass: obviously
* The Great Suspender: suspends inactive tabs. Frees up toooons of memory
* Stylish: custom themes for webpages. Install all the ones in the "stylish" dir.
* Event Merge for Google Calendar: visually merges identical events on multiple calendars
