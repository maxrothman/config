# Tools I use
* iTerm2
* Alfred
* VSCode
* Slack
* VLC

## Tools I'm on the fence about
* Dash
  * Not thrilled about the switch to a subscription model, not sure how much longer I'll keep this one
* Hyperswitch
  * Investigating alternatives, can be flaky
* LastPass
  * Maybe I can replace this with Mac's new password manager?
* Chrome
  * Would love to replace it...
* Evernote
  * Would REALLY love to replace it...

# Tools I have known and loved but don't need on every machine
* BetterTouchTool: automate anything
* Karabiner: remap any key. No really, any key. Last used to make media buttons on a custom keyboard act correctly.
* Database viewer: I've used a few and been only marginally satisified:
  * Tableplus: table viewer is pretty good, but the query editor kind of sucks
  * Postico: postgres-only, haven't used recently
  * pgAdmin: what a mess, don't use this
* AppCleaner: fully uninstall apps (including those pesky Application Support files)
* USB Overdrive: used to wire up the special buttons on a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 keyboard
* Tunnelblick: my preferred VPN client. I've got a matching Alfred workflow to control it

# Tools I no longer use
## Mac Apps

* Itsycal: replaces the menu bar datetime display and adds a calendar panel on click. Haven't used
  since Mac made clicking the date open the notification center.
* coconutBattery: replaces the menu bar battery display and adds remaining time prediction (removed in Sierra)
  * After downloading and starting, click menu bar icon and open "Preferences"
  * Select "Launch at Startup" and "Show Icons"
  * Change format to `%r`
* MagicPrefs: fully customize magic mouse/touchpad gestures (just using for magic mouse ATM)
  * map one finger middle click to middle click (required futzing with the area)
  * map three finger touch to "Application Windows"
* Hammerspoon: advanced OSX automation in Lua. Eventually, I'll finish the window manager with this.
* Stay: save window positions when changing monitor configs
* GPG Suite: decent keychain-like tool for GPG en/decrypting. Sure beats using the command line
* Gifox: Make gif screen recordings, useful for demonstrating QA. Maybe superseded by Mac's new
  screenshot tool?

## Chrome plugins

* MoveTab: a tool I wrote for moving tabs from one window to another with a keyboard shortcut. https://github.com/maxrothman/movetab
* The Great Suspender: suspends inactive tabs. Frees up toooons of memory. I think chrome does this
  by default now?
* Hacker Vision: I have a key for the pro version (it's free for a year). Flips colors on webpages for which there aren't Stylish themes
* Stylus: lets you apply custom styles to webpages
  * I used to use this more before more websites had dark themes
  * I also used to use it to adjust github's diff highlights for my colorblindness. Keeping that
    stylesheet up to date as github changed their UI was a pain so I haven't kept up with it.
* Surfingkeys: navigate webpages using the keyboard
  * This does a million things, but the only one I use is the "show typeable flags for all the
    clickable things on the page". Turning off all the other features is a pain, and they change how
    the configuration works regularly. I haven't used this much recently as a result.
