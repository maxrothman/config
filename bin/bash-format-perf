;; When running a bash script with `-x`, bash outputs the timestamp at which each command was
;; started, along with the stack depth of the command and the command itself. This script parses
;; that format and replaces the timestamps with relativing timings, so that the number next to each
;; command is how long the command took to execute.
;; 
;; This script is really simple and has lots of room for improvement. Most significantly, some
;; commands contain newlines, which leads to a timing file that looks like this:
;;
;; ++++ 1606154722.870975000	 __git_am_inprogress_options='--skip
;;   --continue
;;   --resolved
;;   --abort
;;   --quit
;;   --show-current-patch
;; '
;;
;; This script chokes on those lines, so they have to be manually removed first. An obvious
;; improvement would be to remove that limitation, but that would require changing the `map` to a
;; more general looping approach, which was out-of-scope last time I touched this file.
