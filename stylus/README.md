# Personal webpage styles

Some of the stylesheets in this directory are intended to overlay 3rd-party custom
styles (i.e. from [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/)), while others are
modified styles (likely from the same sources). Currently, the github-dark style is
both the only one in active use and the only one that overlays a 3rd-party style. So
long as it is added to the page after the 3rd-party style, it will overlay correctly.
AFAICT, this means it has to appear in the Stylus list after the 3rd-party style.
