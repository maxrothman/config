# Personal webpage styles

I use [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) to
theme some websites I use frequently with dark styles and other small enhancements.

After installing
[Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), install
these public themes:

* [Dark Bitbucket.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/166677/dark-bitbucket-org)

Some of the themes I use are [usercss](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Usercss), so their
installation method is different. To install each of the styles below, just open their links in your
browser:

* [Github dark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark/master/github-dark.user.css)

I also apply some hand-written custom styles, contained in this directory. Add them to Stylus manually.

In particular, my Github Dark overrides style overlays the public Github Dark style, so it must appear in Stylus' styles list **after** the public one.
