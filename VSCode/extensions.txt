Needs evaluating:
Github Pull Requests: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github
    There was some critical missing feature last time, but I don't remember what it was

    Does a lot of stuff, haven't wrapped my head around it

    What does this do? Is it necessary?

    Is this really not enabled by default? Or is this feature provided by some other plugin?
Markdown Preview Enhanced: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced
    Do I still need this? Maybe has an extra feature or two, but maybe not worth it
hoogle-vscode: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jcanero.hoogle-vscode
    Do I actually use this, or do I use dash more often?
Live Server: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
    Not sure how often I use this, I think it works only for static pages.
